# Speech Recognition Upgrade - Quick Summary

## 🎯 Problem Fixed
Twilio was hearing wrong words (e.g., "from" instead of "Ali Osama")

## ✅ Solution Applied

### **1. Upgraded Speech Model**
Changed from `phone_call` → `numbers_and_commands` (Twilio's BEST model for conversations)

### **2. Enhanced Recognition (Always On)**
Enabled premium ASR for maximum accuracy

### **3. Added 50+ Smart Hints**
Including: names, addresses, moving terms, Texas cities, numbers, yes/no variations

### **4. Increased Timeout**
4 seconds → 5 seconds (gives users more time to speak)

### **5. Disabled Profanity Filter**
Won't censor legitimate words anymore
